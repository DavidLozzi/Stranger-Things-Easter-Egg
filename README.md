# Stranger Things Easter Egg
A small easter egg for you to throw into your site which will bring on The Upside Down.

## How to Install
Download support.js, reference it on your page.

## How to Use
Determine the best place to trigger the Easter Egg. I put it on a handler on the search solution I'm working on. If the user searches for `Stranger Things` it triggers. The type of system I'm working on, that will never happen. I also ensure that it has to be case sensitive, so users can bypass it if desired.

## What's next?
I'd like to see about:
* npm project to easily pull into any project
* add the Mind Flayer image in the background as it rotates
* the site remains usable when it's done except for scrolling, can't scroll up or down (or down or up)
* get rid of the scroll bars when it rotates
